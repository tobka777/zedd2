# Zedd-App

The Zedd-App is a Grindstone-like application that automates booking in Platform and simplifies working with multiple
accounts. It operates as an interactive calendar, allowing you to schedule tasks and manage your work time efficiently.

The goal is to make work planning more organized, stress-free and user-friendly. The app is built with Electron,
TypeScript, React, MobX, and MUI.

## Features üìù

- Tasks can be exported to the Platform system with the option of automatic submission
- Export can also take place in the background
- Importing tasks from the Platform system
- Individual names for tasks that can be assigned to a Platform task and a comment
- Tasks can be linked to Jira tasks
- Forecast booking possible with "Ersatz" task

## Usage üî•

Press the button `IMPORT` and select `ALL` in the dropdown to import Platform accounts. This needs to be repeated when
new accounts are added to Platform that you want to book on. Usually, importing a single project is enough.

Enter what you are currently working on in the field `Currently Timing`. This does not necessarily have to be a Platform
account.
If JIRA is configured, tickets from Jira will be suggested.

Enter the Platform account for the task in `Platform-Account for Task ...`. This can also be done later/Friday and is
retroactive.

Optionally, add a comment in `Platform-Account Comment for This Task`. The tag is automatically calculated and entered
in Platform beforehand.

At the bottom, you can see what will be exported to Platform. What is currently displayed will always be exported. The
`Autosubmit` checkbox next to the `Platform` button will submit the timesheets as well.

### Jira Integration

The Zedd-App enables an integration of Jira. Thus, the issues can be used as names for the timeslots.
When searching for tasks, Jira is requested.

In the settings, the url of Jira must be entered under PL Jira.
The Personal Access Token must be generated in Jira (
see [Instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html)) and stored
in the Settings under Token.
